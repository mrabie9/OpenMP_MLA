## CIFAR-10 CNN

---

**A Generic CNN application trained on CIFAR-10 Dataset**

This repository was created based on the [CNN application case study](https://community.arm.com/developer/ip-products/processors/b/processors-ip-blog/posts/deploying-convolutional-neural-network-on-cortex-m-with-cmsis-nn) implemented with CMSIS-NN kernels targeting Arm Cortex-M MCUs.
In this exaple CNN application stil uses the [CMSIS-NN](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5) kernels added in the root folder as submodule. 
Thus, you can use such kernels to compile and execute this application using any Arm architecture supported by CMSIS-NN kernels.

Before you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the **Source** page, but check out the **Commits**, **Branches**, and **Settings** pages.
